# c-- V2
c-- is a very interesting language. Like how c++ means c but 1 better, c-- means c but a lot worse. It's an interpreted language that skips the lexer and has you type the token formated code making it very hard to understand. The commands are bellow, be warned, you brain will hurt a lot. This is a joke langauge just for fun but try to use it if you want. Run the program and input the file (be careful, you can't use \n). There is next to no error detection in the code while running and there are probably many bugs.

# Features

 * Basic variables
 * Functions + recurrsion
 * Comments
 * Basic math (no order of operations)
 * Brain damage of course too

# Functions

## Built-ins
 - <999> input for print
 - <1000> print function

## Math
- *, -, +

## Other
 - = assignment
 - call calls a function
 - func creats a function (<0> = func)
 - jmp jumps to a line
 - retrn returns from a function (defining its bounds)
 - end ends the program

# Future

Note sure what will become of this to be honest.
